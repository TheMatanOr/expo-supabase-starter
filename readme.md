## Introduction

Vision App is a mobile application that helps users write down their vision, goals, and dreams, then track how many times they read it each day. The app is built with React Native and Expo, using Supabase as the backend, and integrates various technologies such as Expo Router for navigation, Tailwind CSS for styling, React-Hook-Form for form handling, Zod for schema validation, and TypeScript for type safety.

The app guides users through an onboarding process where they:

1. Enter their name
2. Select their gender
3. Write their personal vision statement
4. Choose how many times per day they want to read their vision (5, 10, or 20 times - with 10 being recommended)

After onboarding, users can track their daily progress and build consistent habits around reading their vision.
